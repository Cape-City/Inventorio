#### Warning! The current version has numerous bugs.
Consider this a snapshot: it's technically playable, but can (and will) change in major incompatible ways.
That said, it can be compiled and played with.
#### I aim the eventual release version to be applicable long-term for both Survival and Creative
Including the ability to remove the mod and continue your world without it.
